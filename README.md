## Introduction

For the past two weeks of training at the tech academy, I worked on developing a full scale CRUD Web Application in Python. The App I choice to design and build was a Movie Lists app which sorted Movies based off their ratings. This was a great learning expierence using Django, Debugging, adding requested features. Through this sprint, One of the things I enjoyed doing the most was working on the [back end stories](#back-end-stories). I also got a great deal of expience from working on the [front end stories](#front-end-stories). I honestly believe the skills i learned from using Agile project managemnent will translate well and will be used greatly in my future careers.
